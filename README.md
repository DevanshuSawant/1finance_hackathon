# AI Amplify 24-Hour Hackathon

This is a Repository for the AI Amplify 24 Hour Hackathon Solution by Team United whose members are Devanshu, Shanthanu, Yash, Ayush And Musab


## Event Details

- **Date:** 22 July, 2023
- **Duration:** 24 hours
- **Location:** [1Finance,Goregaon]("https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lotus+Corporate+Park/@19.1447447,72.8554805,16.33z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3be7b7b95e533c2d:0xc1ad242d613c1395!8m2!3d19.1449661!4d72.853261!16s%2Fg%2F11sxb56krv?entry=ttu")



## Problem Statements

Participants will work on three intriguing problem statements with varying levels of difficulty:

### Problem Statement 1: Recognizing Flower Types with Convolutional Neural Network
**Difficulty: HARD**

In this challenge, participants will develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize different types of flowers, including Rose, Chamomile, Dandelion, Sunflower, and Tulip. The provided dataset consists of labeled images of these flowers. Your task is to create a robust CNN model that can accurately classify the flowers.

### Problem Statement 2: Inventory Demand Forecasting
**Difficulty: MODERATE**

For this problem statement, participants will tackle the task of inventory demand forecasting. Given historical sales and inventory data, your goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast future demand for products accurately. This is a critical business problem that can help companies optimize their inventory management and improve customer satisfaction.

### Problem Statement 3: Amazon Product Review Analysis using Recurrent Neural Network
**Difficulty: EASY**

In this relatively easier challenge, participants will work on sentiment analysis for Amazon product reviews. You will build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model capable of analyzing and classifying product reviews into positive or negative sentiments. This can be a valuable tool for businesses to understand customer feedback and make data-driven decisions.

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your solution:

1. Create a new folder for each problem statement within the repository.
2. Place your code and any relevant documentation or instructions inside the respective folders.
3. Ensure your code is well-commented and easy to understand.
4. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository before the hackathon deadline.

## Judging Criteria

The submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Accuracy:** How well does your model perform on unseen data?
- **Innovation:** Did you try any unique approaches or techniques?
- **Code Quality:** Is your code well-organized, documented, and easy to follow?
- **Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to showcase your work to the judges.

## Prizes

Participants will have the chance to win exciting prizes and opportunities from our sponsors and organizers.
